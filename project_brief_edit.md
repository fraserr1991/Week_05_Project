### Coffee Equipment Shop Inventory

Build an app which allows a shopkeeper to track their shop's coffee equpiment inventory. This is not an app which the customer will see, it is an admin/management app for the shop workers.

#### MVP

* The inventory should track individual products, including a name, description, stock quantity, buying cost, and selling price.
* The inventory should track manufacturers, including a name and when they were established.
* The shop will sell coffee equipment, and should be able to create and edit manufacturers and products separately.
  * This might mean that it makes more sense for a car shop to track makes and models of cars. (This isn't technically a manufacturer it's probably more a "retailer") 
* Show an inventory page, listing all the details for all the products in stock in a single view.
* As well as showing stock quantity as a number, the app should visually highlight "low stock" and "out of stock" items to the user.
